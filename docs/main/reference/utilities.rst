Utilities
====================================================

The utilities module contains a collection of functions that are used in different parts of the project.
Some basic plotting functions for the simulation results are included, as well as a function that enables synchronized animation of the simulation.
The utilities module is not required for the simulation to run, but is used to generate plots or additional functionality if needed.
