Enumerations
====================================================
This module contains all enumerations used in the project.
This enables a structured set of options and values for the user to choose from.
The module contains enumerations for the different modes that are tracked, the key performance indicators that are calculated, the tracked locations and the supply chain configurations (LogisticType).
Also, custom exceptions are defined to handle errors in the simulation.
